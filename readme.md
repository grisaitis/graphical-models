# graphical models

"Probabilistic graphical models" is a framework or formalism for describing many probalistic models in machine learning and statistics. Models that can be defined and analyzed in this framework include linear regression, gaussian mixtures, many latent variable models, markov networks, bayesian networks, latent dirichlet allocation, hierarchical linear regression, conditional random fields, restricted boltzmann machines, and many more i can't think of.

in general, a graphical model is a representation of a joint probability distribution of a set of random variables. variables are nodes in a graph, and edges are "associations" between variables - correlations, conditional probabilities, potential functions, etc - depending on the model.

this is part of my auditing [CMU's class on probabilistic graphical models](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708-20/) led by Eric Xing.
